## Instructions

Here are the outlined tasks using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook - to create a report that includes the following data (beginning with the District Summary" 


## Two Observable Trends
- Charter schools performed significantly better than district schools as seen is Scores by School Type
- The per student budgets are lower for charter schools than for district schools when comparing in the school summary, and higher-performing and lower-performing school data.



### District Summary

Create a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the district's key metrics, including the following:

* Total schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)




### School Summary

Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)



### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Math Scores by Grade

Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

CWM: I TOOK AS SHOT AT THIS ONE BUT COULDN'T PULL IT THROUGH

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size

CWM:NOT ABLE TO COMPLETE
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).


### Scores by School Type

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter).
ins your report.
